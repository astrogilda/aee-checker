# aee-checker

An independent validity-gate checker for the **Adversarial Execution Evidence (AEE)** in-toto predicate (v0.6, [in-toto/attestation#570](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/pull/570)), implemented **from the specification text alone**: the four byte-pure stage-one validity steps (statement well-formedness, coverage validity, the result recompute, digest integrity) plus the trust-relative evidence tier, run against the [probityai/agent-evidence-vectors](https://github.com/probityai/agent-evidence-vectors) vector corpus.

**suiteRevision 1: 125/125 parity** (34/34 accepts including result tokens, 91/91 rejects) on the first full corpus run, blind, with no vector-driven fixes.

**suiteRevision 2: 138/138** (35/35 accepts, 103/103 rejects) after a spec-diff-led update. Run against the new corpus unchanged first, the same build scored 132/138; the six vectors separating the two runs, and what each contract change was, are in the report. That second pass is deliberately **not** described as blind: the changelog and vector names were read before the spec passages were, so the honest claim is *independent checker, spec-diff-led update, conformance verified*.

**suiteRevision 3: 140/140** (35/35, 105/105) on the first run with the checker unchanged. The revision adds two forcing vectors for the reason-map side of the coverage-partition rule; this checker's rule for it came from the spec text and predates them, so the two met rather than one driving the other.

**suiteRevision 5: 149/149** (35/35, 114/114) after a parser fix. The unchanged revision-3 build scored **148/149** against it, and the single miss is worth stating plainly because the causation runs the other way this time: the revision pins a nesting bound the earlier text did not state, this checker had picked 256, and the new `bad-741` vector found it. Not blind, and not a case of the two meeting. The bound was only the visible half. The revision also states the counting rule, and this parser had been incrementing per parsed value rather than per open container, which read exactly one level deeper than the spec rule on **every document in the corpus** — all 149 statements and every record payload inside them, measured on the raw bytes so the deliberately ill-formed vectors are covered too — because every deepest path in the corpus ends in a scalar. Changing only the constant scores 149/149 as well, and still rejects a statement at depth 128 that the spec calls valid. What keeps the corpus from telling the two fixes apart is not its maximum depth, since `bad-741`'s payload sits at 130, but that nothing in it sits at 128, the one depth where the two readings disagree: a scalar leaf inside 128 open containers reads as 129 to a per-value counter and 128 to a per-container one, and at 129 both reject. That boundary is pinned in this parser's own tests instead. The revision's other half, the encoding rules, needed no change here: this checker rejected ill-formed UTF-8, CESU-8, overlong forms and unpaired surrogate escapes from the first build.

**suiteRevision 6: 153/153** (36/36, 117/117) after implementing the noncharacter exclusion. The unchanged revision-5 build scored **151/153**. Two of the four new vectors are the depth-boundary pair, `ok-036` and `bad-742`, and the container-branch counter already handled both; the other two, `bad-743` and `bad-744`, carry Unicode noncharacters in a vocabulary label and a payload value, which this checker admitted. It admitted them because the earlier text scoped its MUST to well-formed sequences of Unicode scalar values, and a noncharacter is one; the revision widens the rule to the RFC 7493 section 2.1 exclusion the strict-I-JSON label had always implied. **This one is directed, and more so than revision 2 was:** the rule was written and the vectors named before this checker ran, so what it demonstrates is that the corrected rule is implementable from the text, not that an independent reader found it.

**Predicate v0.7, suiteRevision 22: blind 179/232, directed 232/232.** v0.7 is breaking with no
alias, so the revision-6 build refuses every v0.7 statement at the type check. The number that bears
on whether the text is determinate from a cold start is the **blind 179/232** (8/54 accept, 169/176
reject, 2/2 indeterminate), run under a protocol published before the spec was readable. The
directed 232/232 followed a spec diff already read and an adversarial review of this implementation,
and is not evidence about the text. Reason parity is reported separately and is not verdict parity.
Full record in [`reports/v0.7-RUN.md`](reports/v0.7-RUN.md).

**suiteRevision 27: 272/272** (61/61 accepts, 209/209 rejects, 2/2 indeterminate) with the checker **unchanged** — byte-identical `checkerSourceDigest` to revision 26. The corpus advanced 282 commits and 250 -> 272 vectors and the frozen build agreed on every one, so no vector-driven fix is possible in either direction. That is the whole claim: *this build, frozen before the corpus moved, still agrees with it after*. Not a statement about the specification's determinacy from a cold start — the figure that bears on that is still the blind 179/232. Pre-registered in [`PIN-rev27-RUN.md`](PIN-rev27-RUN.md), which was committed before the record and discloses that an unregistered exploratory pass preceded it. **Scope, because the number invites a wider reading than it earns:** the corpus is pinned to spec `0dbe10bc` while the pull request head is `25ac8581`, 4393 bytes apart, and the head's new refusal-set rule — *a verifier MUST NOT name a conjunct it did not reach* — is exercised by **no vector in this corpus**. This run is not evidence of compliance with it, and that question is open.

[PARITY-REPORT.md](PARITY-REPORT.md) carries the scores, the interpretation decisions the spec text forced, the four formerly-open corners and how each was closed, and the from-spec discipline attestation listing exactly what was and was not read for each revision. [NOTES.md](NOTES.md) compares the vendored spec against the branch-head spec.

No dependency on the reference implementation: this crate carries its own strict I-JSON parser, RFC 8785 canonicalization with ECMAScript number formatting, RFC 6962 domain-separated Merkle root over DSSE PAE bytes, run-binding derivation, and Ed25519 tier verification against the suite's seed-derived test key.

## How this checker was written

This checker was written with AI coding agents, mainly Claude Code from Anthropic, directed and reviewed by the maintainer. Most commits on `main` carry a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer, but the trailer is not a complete record: merge commits, several squash-merged changes and a few direct commits do not carry it. Earlier versions of this README and of the parity report did not say any of this, and they should have.

That bears on what the scores above can show. The from-spec discipline in [PARITY-REPORT.md](PARITY-REPORT.md) records what was read during each run; it cannot record what the model had seen before, and it does not make this checker independent of other agent-written implementations. Implementations of one specification written by coding agents fail together more often than independence predicts, and many of the shared failures trace to parts of the specification that are hard or ambiguous ([Ron, Baudry and Monperrus, arXiv 2606.20158](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.20158)). Agreement between this checker and another agent-written one is therefore weaker evidence that the text determines a reading than it would be if the two failed independently.

## Running

```
git clone https://github.com/probityai/agent-evidence-vectors
git -C agent-evidence-vectors checkout e98de66d7296c4eb01abc38b6aee0b51b0c87a8e
cargo run --locked --release -- agent-evidence-vectors/vectors --json fresh.json
python3 scripts/compare-report.py fresh.json reports/v0.7-rev27-directed-run.json
```

The checkout is pinned deliberately. `main` moves, and a later revision would run
a different corpus against the claim on this page, which is the one thing a
reproduction recipe must not do quietly. **This recipe was itself stale until
2026-09-06**, pinning `8959bd32` — the revision-6 corpus, which is v0.6 — against
a v0.7 report, so it could not reproduce anything: the v0.7 build refuses every
v0.6 statement at the type check. A recipe that does not run is a worse failure
than a recipe that runs the wrong corpus, and it survived because nothing
executed it. CI now pins the same commit this recipe names. Earlier revisions are reproducible the
same way by taking their suite pin and checker commit from
[`reports/INDEX.json`](reports/INDEX.json).

Exit code 0 on full parity, 1 on any mismatch. Reject reasons are this implementation's own prose. **The condition codes are not independent of the suite's, and this sentence used to say they were.**

The sentence was written on 2026-07-24, when this checker emitted no condition codes at all, and it was true then. It went stale on 2026-08-03, when #8 introduced 23 codes -- all 23 appear verbatim in the corpus manifest's `expected.codes` vocabulary, and every one of them existed in the corpus between 3 and 13 days earlier, so the names came from the suite rather than the other way round. That origin was not concealed: #8's own commit message says the runner "scores reason parity directly against the corpus's declared codes", and `PROTOCOL-v0.7.md` rule 5 permits reading the corpus once the blind number is published, which #7 had already done. What was wrong is that #10 restated the sentence on 2026-08-08 as though it still held.

For contrast, 16 codes have been added since, against a set of conditions the corpus names in every one of the 16 cases, and 3 appear in that vocabulary. Treat one of the three as contaminated: `sealed-record-absent` was named during a correction pass on a day the vocabulary was already being read. The other 15 were derived from this checker's own reason strings, and 2 of those coincide. So somewhere between 13% and 19% is what independently naming the same conditions looks like here, and 23 of 23 is not that.

None of the 23 appears in the pinned spec text, verified against the digest `spec/VENDOR-PIN.json` names. Several do appear in `vectors/CHANGES.md` and in vector filenames, both of which this repository discloses reading, so a disclosed adjacent source explains part of the match and not all of it.

A reason-parity figure computed against that vocabulary therefore measures how completely the naming was aligned, not whether the same condition was identified independently, and no such figure is published on that basis.

`--role <name>` overrides the pinned test-key role, and `--discover-role <vector.json>` re-runs the role probe against a vector's signatures.

## What this is not

The checker verifies validity and recomputes `result` from the carried bytes. It does not evaluate consumer policy beyond the corpus's pinned test key, and parity with the reference corpus is a claim about the specification's determinacy, not about the security of any assessed artifact.
